# [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

For example, `2` is written as `II` (two ones added together). `12` is written as `XII` (X + II), and `27` as `XXVII` (XX + V + II).

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, for certain values, subtraction is used, which is indicated by placing a smaller numeral before a larger numeral. The six instances where subtraction is applied are:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `s = "III"`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** `III = 3`.

### Example 2
- **Input:** `s = "LVIII"`
- **Output:** `58`
- **Explanation:** `L = 50`, `V = 5`, `III = 3`.

### Example 3
- **Input:** `s = "MCMXCIV"`
- **Output:** `1994`
- **Explanation:** `M = 1000`, `CM = 900`, `XC = 90`, `IV = 4`.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid Roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.
